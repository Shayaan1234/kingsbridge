### Neighborhood Rankings 

The three most important qualities when ranking Airbnb bookings in the Bronx Team: 

**1. Safety** (low crime rate) 

**2. Transportation** (accessibility to & reliability of public transportation, ease of parking) 

**3. Attraction/Activities** (availability of local attractions and recreational activities such as restaurants, parks, etc.) 


#### **Kingsbridge Ranking** 

**_Overall Niche Grade: B_** 

**Safety: C** (Relatively low crime rate, but higher than national rate of crime per 100,000 residents for assault and robbery.) 

**Transportation: B+** (Ease of parking, and public transportation is available and accessible but some reviews have mentioned that it can be unreliable at times with long commutes, delays, etc.) 

**Attractions/Activities: A** (Has an urban city feel with good outside spaces, proximity to bars, restaurants, parks, etc. and has nice views.)

### Individual Data Analysis 

  Similarly to the group analysis, I began by cleaning the data, and deciding what specifically I wanted to look at in my code. I began playing around with ```describe()``` and ```value_counts()``` functions, and other printing functions, before I decided to start by simply looking at how many listings each of the four neighborhoods that my group is working with has. As it turns out, Kingsbridge had the highest number of listings in my_bronx, which is what I referred to the four neighborhoods in my code. I was even more pleasantly surprised, however, when I found that Kingsbridge actually had the highest number of listings in all of the Bronx neighborhoods. 

  Below are the printed neighborhood listing statistics for my_bronx and bronx: 
 

```markdown
stats for listings in my_bronx:
count             225
unique              4
top       Kingsbridge
freq               70
Name: neighbourhood, dtype: object

stats for listings in bronx:
count            1091
unique             48
top       Kingsbridge
freq               70
Name: neighbourhood, dtype: object
```

I decided to make a graph to visualize to visually see the percentage of the listings that are in Kingsbridge, compared to the other neighborhoods in my_bronx.




According to this graph, Allerton has the smallest percentage of listings in my_bronx. My first hypothesis for this was that Allerton covered a smaller area, compared to the Kingbridge, since Kingsbridge covers 1.45 square miles, with 49,208.93 people per square mile, which gives it a population of 71,360 (HC2). 

However, I then found out that Allerton actually had a larger area than Kingsbridge (2.34 square miles), and had a greater population (103,732), albeit with (44,413.52 people per square mile). Therefore, it may be probable that there are fewer listings because the houses and apartments are more spread out, but then again, Allerton may not have as many rent-friendly properties as Kingsbridge to begin with. After all, out of the 29,973 housing units available in Kingsbridge, 67.86% of the occupied units are renter-occupied, while 90.01%  of the vacant units are either for rent or for some other purpose (HC2). Of course, we have no data that shows how many of these vacancies are reserved for airbnb, but they are still interesting to consider.
